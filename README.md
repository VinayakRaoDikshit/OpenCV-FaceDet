# Very basic face detection using OpenCV
- Trying my hands on and getting familiar with OpenCV.
- Nothing new, novel or fancy here. 
- This code, sadly, hasn't completely been written by me. Google, stackoverflow, Generative AI have been used.
- More details about the methodology, refer to the Jupyter notebook.
